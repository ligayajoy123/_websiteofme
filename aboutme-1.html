<h2 style="text-align:center;">1ST YEAR CS STUDENT</h2>
<img src="joyful.jpg" alt="me" style="width: 20%";>

<p> I am Joy Mildred Baugbog 1st year major in computer science, 18 years old. As a person and individual in the society I learn from others in order to create my own outlook of life. 
Fighting for injustice in society and willing to disregard the consequences faced by my actions, contribute myself for improvment, has high sense of duty and honor. </p>

<p> My guiding principle is to "don't do things for the sake of doing them". Don't be afraid to quit the things that dont serve your path. Do the things you love, because life is 
precious to spend doing anything else. If you don't enjoy something, then don't do it. Spend time and energy on things that bring fulfillment and happiness. I'm different from others
in a way of I lack of confidence, I'm not good at communicating others and I'm an introvert person. Like others I eat, sleep and feel emotions too. Everyone has its own way of living
thier life and that's makes us different from others. </p>

<p> I don't have much accomplishment in my life. I once attended a competition in my elementary days and graduated as an honor students. I graduate my senoir highschool an honor student 
too. Even though it's not much I'm proud to achieve this accomplishment. My dream is to graduate with good grades to find a job. A stable one to hepp/support my family. After it I'll 
treat myself like traveling to many places and to explore more. </p>
